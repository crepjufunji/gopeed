
 
Office 2013 is a software suite that can run on different versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system. Depending on your system, you can choose to install either the 32-bit or the 64-bit version of Office 2013. If you have a 64-bit Windows operating system, you can still run the 32-bit version of Office 2013, but it will operate in the 32-bit compatibility mode of the Windows operating system. This means that some features and performance may be limited. To take full advantage of your 64-bit Windows operating system, you may want to install the 64-bit version of Office 2013 instead. For more information about the differences and benefits of the 64-bit version of Office 2013, please refer to this article: [Choose between the 64-bit or 32-bit version of Office](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/choose-between-the-64-bit-or-32-bit-version-of-office-2dee7807-8f95-4d0c-b5fe-6c6f49b8d261). The following table shows which Windows operating systems are compatible with each version of Office 2013.
