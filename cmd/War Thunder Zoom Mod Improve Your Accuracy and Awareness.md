## How to Zoom In and Out in War Thunder
 
There are different ways to zoom in and out in War Thunder, depending on the type of vehicle you are using and the control mode you have selected. Here are some of the most common methods:

- **Mouse wheel:** By default, you can use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out of your vehicle's view. This works for both aircraft and ground vehicles, and allows you to adjust the zoom level gradually. However, some players may find this method too slow or imprecise, especially in fast-paced situations.
- **Right mouse button (RMB):** You can also use the RMB to toggle between the minimum and maximum zoom settings for your vehicle's view. This works for both aircraft and ground vehicles, and allows you to quickly switch between a wide and a narrow field of view. However, some players may prefer to have more control over the zoom level, or may want to use the RMB for other functions.
- **Shift + RMB:** If you have your controls on simple mode, you can press Shift + RMB to go into full zoom mode. This works for ground vehicles only, and allows you to zoom in to the maximum magnification of your vehicle's optics. This can be useful for sniping or spotting distant targets. However, some players may find this method too restrictive or inconvenient, especially if they need to switch between different zoom levels frequently.
- **Z key:** You can also use the Z key (or any other key you have mapped) to zoom in on your target. This works for both aircraft and ground vehicles, and allows you to zoom in on the point where your crosshair is aiming. This can be useful for aiming more accurately or identifying your target's weak spots. However, some players may find this method too disorienting or distracting, especially if they need to look around while zooming.
- **B key:** You can also use the B key (or any other key you have mapped) to activate your binoculars. This works for ground vehicles only, and allows you to zoom in on a specific area of the battlefield from a third-person perspective. This can be useful for scouting or spotting enemies behind cover or obstacles. However, some players may find this method too risky or cumbersome, especially if they need to move or shoot while using binoculars.

## How to Use a Zoom Mod in War Thunder
 
If you are not satisfied with the default zoom settings in War Thunder, or if you want to have more options and features for zooming in and out, you may want to use a zoom mod. A zoom mod is a modification that changes or adds new functions for zooming in War Thunder. For example, a zoom mod may allow you to adjust the zoom sensitivity, change the zoom levels, enable smooth transitions between zoom levels, add custom crosshairs or indicators, etc.
 
However, before you use a zoom mod in War Thunder, you should be aware of some important points:

- **Not all zoom mods are allowed:** War Thunder has a strict policy regarding mods that affect gameplay or give unfair advantages. Some zoom mods may be considered as such by the developers or the anti-cheat system, and may result in a ban or a warning. Therefore, you should always check if a zoom mod is approved by the developers before using it. You can find a list of approved mods on the official War Thunder forum or website.
- **Not all zoom mods are compatible:** War Thunder is constantly 8cf37b1e13
