# How to Download MacOSX Tiger 10.4.7 ISO for Free
 
MacOSX Tiger 10.4.7 is an old version of the operating system that runs on PowerPC Macs and some Intel Macs. It was released in 2006 and has been discontinued by Apple since 2009. However, some users may still want to use it for nostalgic reasons or to run some legacy software that is not compatible with newer versions of MacOS.

If you are looking for a way to download MacOSX Tiger 10.4.7 ISO for free, you have a few options. One option is to use the Macintosh Repository website, which hosts a copy of the Mac OS X Server 10.4.7 Tiger ISO file[^1^]. This is a server-focussed release of Tiger with extra tools and applications added to allow it to provide services to Mac clients. It is a universal binary release, so it will work with compatible Macs using both PowerPC and Intel processors. You will need a serial number to install it, which is provided on the website.
 
Another option is to use the Archive.org website, which hosts a copy of the Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger Retail DVD ISO file[^2^]. This is the original retail version of Tiger that was sold in stores and online. It is not a universal binary release, so it will only work with PowerPC Macs or PPC emulators such as QEMU. You will not need a serial number to install it.
 
To download either of these ISO files, you will need a torrent client such as BitTorrent or uTorrent. You can then open the torrent file from the website and start downloading the ISO file to your computer. Once the download is complete, you can burn the ISO file to a DVD using a software such as ImgBurn or Disk Utility, or mount it as a virtual drive using a software such as Daemon Tools or Virtual CloneDrive.
 
After that, you can boot your Mac from the DVD or the virtual drive and follow the instructions to install MacOSX Tiger 10.4.7 on your hard drive or on a separate partition. You may also want to update your system to the latest version of Tiger (10.4.11) using the software update feature or downloading the updates from Apple's website.
 
That's how you can download MacOSX Tiger 10.4.7 ISO for free and install it on your Mac or emulator. Enjoy!
