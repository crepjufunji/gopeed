## Episode 1: Iron from Ice
 
The first episode introduces us to the main characters and the setting of the game. We start with Gared Tuttle, a squire to Lord Gregor Forrester, who witnesses the Red Wedding and escapes with his lord's sword. He then returns to Ironrath, where he meets Ethan Forrester, the new lord of the house after his father's death. Ethan has to deal with the arrival of Ramsay Bolton, who demands fealty and hostages from House Forrester. We also meet Mira Forrester, Ethan's sister who serves as a handmaiden to Margaery Tyrell in King's Landing. She has to navigate the political intrigues of the court and try to secure an alliance with Tyrion Lannister. Finally, we meet Asher Forrester, Ethan's exiled brother who lives as a sellsword in Essos. He is contacted by his uncle Malcolm, who asks him to return home and help his family.
 
The first episode sets up the main conflict and challenges that the characters will face throughout the game. It also establishes the tone and atmosphere of the game, which is dark, gritty, and violent. The episode has some memorable moments, such as choosing who to save at the Red Wedding, deciding how to rule as Ethan, confronting Ramsay Bolton, and meeting Daenerys Targaryen. The episode also ends with a shocking twist that will affect the rest of the game.
 
The first episode is a strong start for the game series, as it introduces us to the characters and their motivations, and makes us care about their fate. The episode also captures the essence of the show, with its complex plot, moral dilemmas, and brutal consequences. The episode is well-written, well-acted, and well-designed, with some impressive graphics and sound effects. However, the episode also suffers from some technical issues, such as glitches, bugs, and long loading times. The episode also has some gameplay limitations, such as linear paths, limited exploration, and lack of meaningful choices.
 
## Episode 2: The Lost Lords
 
The second episode continues the story of the four main characters and introduces a new one: Rodrik Forrester, Ethan's older brother who survived the Red Wedding but was severely injured. He returns to Ironrath and takes over as lord of the house. He has to deal with the aftermath of Ramsay's visit and try to restore his family's honor and strength. Meanwhile, Gared Tuttle arrives at Castle Black and joins the Night's Watch. He learns about the North Grove, a secret place that Lord Forrester wanted him to find. He also meets Jon Snow, who becomes his mentor and friend. In King's Landing, Mira Forrester faces more troubles after her involvement with Tyrion Lannister. She has to deal with Cersei Lannister's wrath and find a way to help her family. In Essos, Asher Forrester gathers an army of sellswords with his partner Beskha. He also encounters some familiar faces from the show.
 
The second episode develops the characters and their relationships further and adds more layers to their personalities and motivations. It also expands the scope and variety of the game world by showing different locations and cultures. The episode has some exciting moments such as fighting a dragon in Essos or escaping from a dungeon in King's Landing. The episode also ends with a cliffhanger that will affect one of your characters.
 
The second episode is a solid continuation of the game series as it builds on the foundations of the first episode and adds more depth and drama to the story. The episode also improves on some of the technical issues and gameplay limitations of the first episode by fixing some bugs and glitches and adding more options and consequences to your choices. However, the episode still suffers from some problems such as long loading times or inconsistent graphics quality.
