One of the most popular products from Toontrack is the EZkeys line, which is a series of virtual pianos that combine stunning sound quality with powerful features. EZkeys lets you easily create and edit piano parts, as well as access a comprehensive MIDI library of song ideas and styles.
 
But what if you want to take your piano sound to the next level? That's where Toontrack R2R comes in. R2R stands for "room to room", and it is a feature that allows you to simulate different acoustic environments for your EZkeys piano. You can choose from a variety of presets, such as studio, concert hall, church, bedroom, or even create your own custom room.
 
By using R2R, you can add realism, depth and character to your piano sound, as well as adjust the level of reverb, ambience and mic placement. You can also mix and match different rooms for different parts of your song, creating dynamic and interesting transitions.
 
To use R2R, you need to have the Toontrack Product Manager installed on your computer. This is a free application that lets you register, download, install, authorize and update all your Toontrack products in one place. You can find it on the Toontrack website.
 
Once you have the Product Manager, you can download and install the R2R expansion for your EZkeys product. You can then launch EZkeys and select R2R from the drop-down menu in the upper left corner. You will see a graphical interface that shows you the room you are currently using, as well as the controls for adjusting the parameters.
 
You can browse through the presets by clicking on the arrows next to the room name, or use the search function to find a specific room. You can also save your own presets by clicking on the star icon. To switch between different rooms within your song, you can use the song track feature in EZkeys. Simply drag and drop different rooms onto different parts of your song track, and EZkeys will automatically change them when you play back your song.
