Total War Rome II Rise of the Republic is a strategy game that lets you experience the turbulent events of the 4th century BC, when Rome was still a small city-state surrounded by powerful enemies. You can choose from nine playable factions, each with their own unique units, buildings, and objectives. Whether you want to expand your empire, defend your homeland, or forge alliances, you will need to manage your resources, armies, and diplomacy carefully.
 
However, if you want to have some fun and experiment with different scenarios, you can also use Cheat Engine, a popular tool that allows you to modify various aspects of the game. Cheat Engine can help you change your money, movement points, research time, unit size, and more. You can also use it to activate some cheats that are already built into the game, such as god mode, unlimited ammo, and no stress in battle.

You can choose the latest version or any version that is compatible with your system. After downloading the installer, run it and follow the instructions to install Cheat Engine on your computer.
 
## Step 2: Download and Run a Trainer
 
The next step is to download and run a trainer for Total War Rome II Rise of the Republic. A trainer is a program that contains various cheats and options that you can activate using Cheat Engine. You can find many trainers online for different versions of the game. For example, you can download this trainer from FearLess Cheat Engine: [https://fearlessrevolution.com/viewtopic.php?t=123](https://fearlessrevolution.com/viewtopic.php?t=123). This trainer has many features such as minimum money, unlimited movement, fast recruitment, fast construction, easy research, set skill points, set level, reset unit number, god mode, unlimited ammo, no stress in battle, and more.
 
After downloading the trainer file (which is usually a .CT or .CETRAINER file), run it by double-clicking on it or by opening it with Cheat Engine. You should see a window with a list of cheats and options that you can enable or disable by checking or unchecking the boxes next to them.
 
## Step 3: Launch the Game and Attach Cheat Engine
 
The final step is to launch Total War Rome II Rise of the Republic and attach Cheat Engine to it. To do this, open the game and load your campaign or start a new one. Then switch back to Cheat Engine and click on the computer icon on the top left corner of the window. This will open a process list where you can select the game process. Look for Rome2.exe or something similar and click on it. Then click on Open or OK to attach Cheat Engine to the game.
 
## Step 4: Enjoy the Cheats
 
Now you are ready to enjoy the cheats. You can switch back and forth between the game and Cheat Engine to activate or deactivate the cheats that you want. Some cheats may require you to change some values in Cheat Engine or perform some actions in the game to take effect. For example, if you want to change your money amount, you need to enter the desired amount in Cheat Engine and then spend some money in the game to see the change. You can also use hotkeys to toggle some cheats on or off quickly.
 
Please note that some cheats may not work properly or may cause errors or crashes in the game. If this happens, try disabling some cheats or restarting the game. Also, remember to save your game frequently in case something goes wrong.
