# How to Use the Building Pangea Gizmo to Learn About Continental Drift
 
The Building Pangea Gizmo is an interactive simulation that allows you to explore the theory of continental drift, which states that the Earth's continents were once joined in a single landmass called Pangea. You can use the Gizmo to fit the continents together like puzzle pieces, and to examine the evidence from fossils, rocks, and glaciers that supports this theory.
 
To use the Gizmo, follow these steps:

1. Launch the Gizmo from [this link](http://gizmos.explorelearning.com/find-gizmos/lesson-info?resourceId=633).
2. Learn the names of the major landmasses by opening the Tools menu and dragging the Help icon over them. You can also click on the labels to toggle them on or off.
3. Drag and rotate the landmasses to try to fit them together. You can grab a landmass in the middle to move it, or near the edge to rotate it. You can also use the arrow keys to nudge a landmass.
4. When you think you have a good fit, click Check. The Gizmo will show you how well your map matches the shape of Pangea.
5. Click Next to see how fossils of ancient plants and animals can provide clues about how the continents were connected. Drag the Help icon over the fossils to learn their names and locations. Try to arrange the landmasses so that the fossils match up across continents.
6. Click Next again to see how rocks and mountains can also indicate continental connections. Drag the Help icon over the rocks to learn their names and ages. Try to align the rocks and mountains across continents.
7. Click Next once more to see how glacial deposits and scratches can show the direction of ice movement during past ice ages. Drag the Help icon over the glaciers to learn their locations and directions. Try to position the landmasses so that the glaciers make sense.
8. Click Next to see your final score and review your map of Pangea. You can also click Back to go back to any previous step and make changes.

The Building Pangea Gizmo is a fun and educational way to learn about continental drift and plate tectonics. You can use it to test your knowledge, practice your skills, or explore different scenarios. Have fun!
