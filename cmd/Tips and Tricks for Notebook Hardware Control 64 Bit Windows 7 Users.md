Notebook Hardware Control (NHC) is a free software that allows you to monitor and control the hardware components of your laptop. With NHC, you can:
 
- Prolong the battery lifetime and cool down the system with CPU voltage control and ATI clock control.
- Adjust the processor speed with custom dynamic switching and CPU speed control.
- Monitor the battery charge level and system temperature.
- Control and monitor the hard drive with S.M.A.R.T management, acoustic & advanced power management and hard drive temperature monitoring.

NHC works on all notebooks with Intel CPUs, but some features are only available on newer Pentium M CPUs (Centrino). NHC also supports multiple user profiles, so you can change all the settings with one mouse click. You can also set different profiles for AC line operation and battery operation.
